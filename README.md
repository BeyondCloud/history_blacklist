# Intro
- A chrome history filter plugin for filtering sensitive keyword in your browser history.
## Feature
- Auto remove pre-defined sensitive words which he/she might consider inappropriate to appear in the browsing history.
- Support Traditional/Simplified Chinese and English (Might also support other languages but not tested)
- To add new key words, click on the plugin icon > Option. Add any key lowercase words separate by comma ",".
Space will be trimmed. Note that uppercase word doesn't work.

## TODO
- Change blacklist datastructure to Set() to make the list more maintainable
