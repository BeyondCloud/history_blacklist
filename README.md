# Intro
- A chrome history filter plugin for filtering sensitive keyword in your browser history.
## Feature
- Auto remove pre-defined sensitive words which he/she might consider inappropriate to appear in the browsing history.
- Support Chinese and English (Might also support other languages but not tested)
- To add new key words, click on the plugin icon > Option, and add any key words separate by comma "," . Space will be trimmed.

## TODO
- Change blacklist datastructure to Set() to make the list more maintainable
